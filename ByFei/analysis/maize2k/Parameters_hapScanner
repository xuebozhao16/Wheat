#This program is used to genotype whole genome sequenced (WGS) individuals by scanning an existing haplotype library.
#The usage is java -Xms10g -Xmx20g HapScanner.jar parameters_hapScanner.txt > log.txt &
#Please keep the order of following parameters
#The path of reference genome with .fai file in the same folder
/Users/feilu/Documents/database/maize/reference/bwaLib/maizeAGPv4.fa
#The taxaBam file containing information of taxon and its corresponding bam files. The bam file should have .bai file in the same folder
/Users/feilu/Documents/analysisL/pipelineTest/HapScanner/taxaBam.txt
#The posAllele file (with header), the format is Chr\tPos\tRef\tAlt (from VCF format). The positions come from haplotype library.

#The pos files (without header), the format is Chr\tPos. The positions come from haplotype library.
